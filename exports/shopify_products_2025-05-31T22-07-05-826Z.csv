	<h3 id=""consumerWebCopy"">Introduction</h3>
	<p>In the late 1990s, manufacturer-backed teams would come to dominate touring car series around the world. One of the most pre-eminent was Audi, which spared no expense in its pursuit of the top of the podium. Using its base A4 quattro as a platform, Audi developed the car significantly and turned it into a race winner. In addition, Audi sought the best drivers from around the world in to do their creation justice.</p>
	<p>Tamiya recreates this racer on top of the TT-01 E chassis, which is ideal for beginner kit builders. The original release of this Audi came on the Tamiya TA-03 machine.</p>

Mounted on the bathtub frame is a fiberglass reinforced nylon upper deck and gear covers improving rigidity, as well as a 3-piece tie rod providing smooth steering action. The low center of gravity, great balanced design, 4-wheel double wishbone suspension system, and front and rear differential gears all come together to produce excellent operating ability. 70mm-diameter radial tires are paired with metal plated wheels developed just for this model; the high sidewalls make for forgiving turns.</p>

The shaft driven 4WD TT-02 chassis employs a longitudinal layout with the battery on the left and the motor on the right, to offer excellent stability. In addition, it features identical left and right suspension arms and uprights for ease of assembly, plus easy-to-maintain gearboxes. It is a highly adaptable chassis, as it offers 2 different wheelbases, 2 ground clearance settings and 2 tread set-ups in addition to a range of 10 possible gear ratios.

	<p>The R/C model assembly kit recreates the rally oriented 2003 Ford Focus RS Custom on the easy to assemble and drive TT-02 chassis. In 2003, the Ford Motor Co. Team chief engineer Christian Loriaux made various changes to the Focus such as seat position, roll cage and suspension, and improved aerodynamics with the updated bumper shape, hood intake position and large rear wing and more. The 2-liter inline-4 turbo engine was capable of 300PS and 550Nm. This rally car secured second place in the Manufacturer ranking four times during its 7-year race campaign and showed off its strength. This kit recreates a custom street version without sponsor logos.</p>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>The Opel Kadett GT/E released in 1975 was a high-spec version of the Opel Kadett, a car which enjoyed great popularity in Europe in the 1970s. The GT/E had a 2-door coupe body, a high-spec 1.9-liter engine and reinforced suspension. The works Opel Eurohändler team, satellite teams and privateers took part in rally races with modified versions of this car, and in 1976 it secured second place in the manufacturer’s championship in global rally races at the time. This 1/10 scale R/C assembly kit recreates the Opel Kadett GT/E on the versatile MB-01 chassis platform. The MB-01 chassis for this subject is configured in the long wheelbase and midship rear motor / rear wheel drive (MR) configuration to faithfully capture the layout of the actual vehicle.</p>

        <h3>About the MB-01 Chassis</h3>
        <p>The compact, 2WD MB-01 chassis gives a choice of three types of wheelbases, and front- or rear- wheel drive system. Without removing battery pack, motor, and R/C equipment setups from the center frame, simply change attachment directions of final gears and steering linkage to switch between front- and rear-wheel drive; low or high motor position can be chosen for rear-wheel drive cars. The 4-wheel double wishbone suspension features symmetrical structure and friction dampers. Unitized sections such as motor mount, final gears and suspension facilitate ease of assembly and effective maintenance.</p>

		<p>The Toyota Celica GT-Four RC was developed as a homologation car to take part in global rally races, and in 1992, 5,000 units were sold around the world. With its curved, powerful body, this car employed a 2-liter turbo engine with metal turbines and water-based intercooler system, which was capable of 235ps. The 4WD system utilized a center viscous coupling and a Torsen differential at the rear for superior controllability and traction. In 1993 global rally races, the Celica GT-Four (ST185) brought both Manufacturer’s and Driver’s Championships to Toyota for the first time!</p>

	<p>
The Scorcher, a popular and speedy 4WD racing buggy from the late-1980s Tamiya line-up, is back, with a new name and updated body! Made from durable polycarbonate and featuring a stylish large rear wing, the body design drew heavily upon the original Scorcher for inspiration, and can be decorated with the minimum of fuss thanks to the large stickers included. It runs on the easy-assembly shaft-driven 4WD TT-02B, and marries the chassis' controllability with square spike tires for superior grip on rough surfaces. This off-road veteran is back with new features to scorch your rivals!
</p>
	
	<p>Shaft-Driven 4WD and Superior Handling from the TT-02B!
The shaft-driven 4WD TT-02B buggy chassis uses a skid-shaped frame. Its suspension setup uses 4-wheel independent double wishbone suspension with long arms, plus CVA shock units, giving the car assured handling, while left and right suspension arms and uprights are identical to facilitate hassle-free assembly. Front and rear gearboxes include 4-bevel differentials for smooth operation, and are sealed to ensure that dust can't get inside. The top can be removed simply by loosening four screws, making maintenance a breeze. Four different gear ratios can be applied with the use of three separately-sold types of pinion gears, allowing you to match the characteristics of your car setup to the conditions at any given time. Of course, this off-road chassis also includes receiver case and motor cover to protect them from dirt and debris thrown up off of the track.</p>

        <h3>WR-02C Overview</h3>
        <p>The WR-02 chassis features a 2WD drivetrain with fully independent double wishbone suspension. The 185mm wheelbase WR-02C chassis utilizes a sturdy monocoque frame which encompasses and protects the gearbox, enhanced by side members. The gear differential unit housed inside the sealed gearbox receives its power from the centerline-mounted motor and passes it on to the rear wheels. A longitudinal position for the battery pack contributes to the model's optimal weight distribution to ensure that when the City Turbo accelerates in a hurry, it performs a dynamic and thrilling wheelie, cushioned by the wheelie roller bar to ensure that the car doesn't topple over. The steering servo is also positioned along the centerline of the chassis, using a 2 tie-rod setup for straightforward handling. The model also features a 4-wheel independent double wishbone suspension for a smooth ride. For ease of assembly, the gearbox and motor come pre-assembled.</p>

	<p>This is a R/C car replica of the 1992 Diebels-Alt sponsored Team Zakspeed Mercedes-Benz 190 E 2.5-16 Evo.II as it competed in the 1992 DTM racing series in Germany.</p>

<p>Tamiya has faithfully reproduced this sleek racing machine in 1/10 scale on the TT-01 Type E entry-level on-road chassis. The TT-01E chassis incorporates many features to make it easy for the new R/C kit builder to assemble and learn from. In addition to the TT-01E being an ideal platform to start from, R/C hobbyists can expand its potential by adding many of the Hop-Up Options available to increase the cars speed and performance.</p>

<p>The bathtub frame of the evolved shaft-driven 4WD TT-01 Type-E has its motor and battery close to the ground for lower center of gravity and optimum balance. Mounted on the bathtub frame is a fiberglass reinforced nylon upper deck and gear covers improving rigidity, as well as a 3-piece tie rod providing smooth steering action. The low center of gravity, highly balanced design, 4 wheel double wishbone suspension system, and front and rear differential gears all come together to produce an excellent drive. Gold color 6-spoke wheels are paired with racing slick tires for the finishing touch, while a host of Hop-Up Option parts are available to soup up the TT-01 Type-E!</p>

<p>The Opel Calibra V6 Cliff took part in the 1995 running of the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (DTM) series. Entered by Joest Racing with the driver JJ. Lehto, the car was powered by a 2.5-liter V6 engine capable of 420 hp. The distinctive black body with the Cliff logo caught people’s eye, and this car showed off race pace strength in DTM races.</p>

    <section id=""consumerWebCopyDiv"">
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>The Ford Bronco has been sold since 1966, and the Ford Bronco 2021 was announced, with great anticipation, as the sixth-generation model in early 2021, 25 years since the last generation’s release.</p>
		<p>Tamiya’s design team have chosen to give R/C enthusiasts a replica of the best Bronco variant of this new generation. The R/C model assembly kit depicts the 2-door top grade First Edition model. The First Edition Bronco SUV is built for those who have waited patiently for the legend’s return. The First Edition is a loaded Bronco combining the best parts of all Bronco series. First Edition Broncos use the mechanicals of a Badlands, the interior of an Outer Banks and the exterior of a Wildtrak to create the ultimate Bronco! The Tamiya version sits on top of the CC-02 chassis for capable and fun R/C driving on the trails!</p>
		<p>CC-02 Chassis - Off Road, Evolved! Designed for a wide range of off-road scenes including rocky terrain, the CC-02 chassis' ladder frame is inspired by full-size vehicles and is the base for its superior durability. A 4WD setup employs the motor longitudinally behind the front axle with separated gearbox and transfer case, and propeller shafts transmitting power to the differential gears front and rear. Four-link rigid suspension is employed front and rear, with CVA oil dampers for all-encompassing control, even on tricky rock sections. This model comes with 12-spoke black wheels and semi-pneumatic rubber tires.</p>

	<h3 id=""consumerWebCopy"">Overview</h3>
	<p>This R/C kit recreates the Alpine A110 with an orange Jägermeister livery on top of the proven and fun-to-drive M-06 chassis. The Alpine A110 was a French compact coupe featuring a lightweight FRP body based upon a steel backbone, rear-wheel drive chassis with the rear-mounted inline-4 engine positioned longitudinally. Production continued from its debut year 1963 until 1977, and the A110 attained fame after victory in the 1971 rally in Monte Carlo. In 1973, this car became the first World Rally champion and its Jägermeister orange livery version achieved a class victory in German circuit races.</p>

<p>Great RR Performance from the M-06!
The M-06 chassis features a rear-mounted motor, rear-drive setup and has a longitudinally-mounted battery pack, with R/C equipment positioned on either side for optimum balance and a low center of gravity. 4-wheel double wishbone suspension uses dish design wheels, equipped with 60D radial tires at the front and 60D super radial (hard) tires at the rear. In addition, a 3-piece steering linkage offers nimble handling response.</p>

        <h3>About the Porsche 911 RSR 2.8</h3>
        <p>The Porsche Carrera RS 2.7 is a legend of the Porsche 911 series. Developed to join European GT races in 1973, it employed a 2,687cc horizontally opposed 6-cylinder engine capable of 210hp, a lightweight body with improved aerodynamics, and wide rear tires. The Carrera RSR 2.8 racing version increased displacement to 2,808cc and output to over 300hp; in 1973, it was a European GT race champion and took numerous global victories.</p>

        <h3>About the BT-01 Chassis</h3>
        <p>The 2WD BT-01 chassis gives the choice of two types of wheelbases, and front-or rear-wheel drive system. Without removing the battery pack, motor, and R/C equipment setups from the center frame, simply change attachment directions of final gears and steering linkage to switch between front-and rear-wheel drive; front (FR) or midship rear (MR) motor position can be chosen for rear-wheel drive cars. The 4-wheel double wishbone suspension features symmetrical structure and friction dampers. Unitized sections such as the motor mount, final gears and suspension facilitate ese of assembly and effective maintenance.</p>

        <h3>Fighter NXGEN Overview</h3>
        <p>Enter Fighter NXGEN! This is an R/C model assembly kit inspired by full size single seater racing buggies popular in the United States of America. The new DT-04 - a 2WD rear-wheel drive buggy chassis - of course offers ease of assembly and lively performance, which is a characteristic of this series. The product name ""NXGEN"" is based upon the English word ""Next Generation"" and as you can guess from the name, it gives improved off-road performance, and a wealth of setup possibilities compared to its predecessors. Also, front and rear suspension arms, gears and gearbox are shared from DT-02 and DT-03 chassis cars. Furthermore, many option parts from DT-02 and DT-03 chassis can be used for this new chassis iteration.</p>
		<p>The body is a piece to behold as it is comprised of injection molded white polycarbonate. Like the BBX (item 58719), the body components are modular pieces that are screwed onto the main chassis. Unlike the BBX, the body components as previously mentioned are injection molded white polycarbonate rather than vacuum formed clear sheet polycarbonate. The result is an easier assembly process for beginners and veterans alike without having to paint the body. All that is needed is the application of stickers!</p>

        <h3>Porsche 911 GT3 R TT-02 Overview</h3>
        <p>The kit is based on the beginner friendly and highly customizable TT-02 chassis, which allows hobbyists to grow as their driving and building skills develop. The full-size Porsche 911 GT3 R (992) is a car which was developed to conform to GT3 race regulations. It is used by customer teams around the world that compete globally in races such as the Fanatec GT World Challenge Powered by AWS and the SRO Motorsports Group in Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia. The harmonious shape of the 911 emphasizes its heritage while combining it with sophisticated new efficiency. Functionality is paramount too! The body is made of particularly lightweight carbon to reduce vehicle weight. The result: increased agility and precision unparalleled throughout GT racing. The perfect starting point for success on the racetrack. With its increased displacement, the heart of the vehicle – the water-cooled six-cylinder naturally aspirated boxer engine – can achieve up to 416 kW (565 hp). Its purpose is clear: race to win.</p>
		<p>The shaft driven 4WD TT-02 chassis employs a longitudinal layout with the battery on the left and the motor on the right, to offer excellent stability. In addition, it features identical left and right suspension arms and uprights for ease of assembly, plus easy-to-maintain gearboxes. It is a highly adaptable chassis, as it offers 2 different wheelbases, 2 ground clearance settings and 2 tread set-ups in addition to a range of 10 possible gear ratios. It is not short on looks either, with brake disc-shaped wheel hubs and stylish front bumper supports. Mesh-type wheels are paired with racing slick tires.</p>

        <p>Based upon the FF hatchback Peugeot 306, the Peugeot 306 Maxi was developed with dedicated components for rallying. A 2.0-liter naturally aspirated engine in front was capable of 280hp, and the car had enlarged fenders, roof spoiler, and a lightened body. Including the victories in 1996 and 1997 rally races in France, this car achieved many racing successes such as the class championship in the 1996 rally in Monte Carlo and third place in the 5th and 6th races on the 1997 global rally circuit. This R/C model assembly kit is inspired by such rally champions.</p>

Without removing the battery pack, motor, and R/C equipment setups from the center frame, simply change attachment directions of final gears and steering linkage to switch between front-and rear-wheel drive; front (FR) or midship rear (MR) motor position can be chosen for rear-wheel drive cars. The 4-wheel double wishbone suspension features symmetrical structure and friction dampers. Unitized sections such as the motor mount, final gears and suspension facilitate ease of assembly and effective maintenance.</p>

	<p>Arguably the most radical design ever to compete in Formula 1, the Tyrrell P34 caused a sensation when it was revealed to the public. The car's designer, Derek Gardner, wanted to reduce drag by making the frontal area smaller, so instead of two normal-sized tires he used four small diameter tires that could be steered together. This also meant that the tires would be shrouded by the nose, further reducing drag. Making its debut at the 1976 Spanish GP, the car proved to be competitive, and it reached the pinnacle of its success with drivers Jody Scheckter and Patrick Depailler finishing 1st and 2nd respectively at the Swedish GP.</p>

	<p>The Lotus 72 was certainly an attention-grabbing car, and not just because of the stunning performance which swept Jochen Rindt to a world championship in 1970. An unmistakable wedge-shaped silhouette, cockpit-side radiators and torsion bar spring suspension were just some of the notable features in its avant-garde design. Team Lotus were never ones to rest upon their laurels, and the 1972 iteration of the car, the 72D was updated across the board - including a high-profile change of sponsor and a striking black color scheme. Burgeoning Brazilian driving sensation Emerson Fittipaldi was right at home in the 72D, and his 5 victories from 12 races were enough to take him to a maiden drivers' championship and Lotus to yet another team championship crown.</p>

From the 11th race of 1970 in Canada, the team debuted the in-house designed 001, which paved the way for the 003 and 002 cars piloted in 1971 by Stewart and François Cevert respectively. While a unique integrated front wing and nose with radiator just below caught the eye, the 003 utilized an otherwise orthodox, reliable setup. Stewart achieved 6 wins in 11 races including the Monaco GP, more than enough for that season's drivers' and constructors' titles.

	<p>The 1980 IFMA trade show in Cologne, Germany saw the debut of the Honda CX500, the world’s first turbocharged production motorcycle. The liquid-cooled V-twin engine was fitted with a turbo unit which was developed together with IHI (Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries). In conjunction with Honda’s computerized fuel injection system, the 500cc engine produced an impressive 82hp. Other technical advances included a cowling which was designed through extensive wind tunnel testing, Honda’s unique Pro-Link rear suspension, and a 4-step adjustable anti nosedive front suspension. With its progressive design and excellent power, the CX500 was one of the most significant motorcycles ever produced.</p>

<p>The motorcycle, along with the automobile, has played a big role in transporting humans from place to place for many years. Man has always been able to adapt his tools for specific needs, and as the motorcycle became more and more a sport, or leisure transportation vehicle, it has been designed for more specific purposes. The off road, touring, motocross and speed bikes as well as the basic transportation motorcycle can be seen in most countries, but America seems to have a certain styling all its own. This so called ""Chopper style"" came about during the mid 1960's from the many modified Harley's done by members of the many motorcycle clubs around the country. There are many long straight stretches of good, high speed roadways in America, and to sit back comfortably, with feet resting on forward pedals and sitting on a very relaxing saddle, brought about these modifications. The Yamaha Company of Japan is well known for quality bikes around the world, and they have been making bikes for specific areas for years.</p> 
	
<p>The Yamaha XS650 Special released in 1978 had the American look, and since then this company has marketed bikes with similar styling. The XV1000 Virago is their latest, large bore, American styled motorcycle and sure to become popular. Its front wheel caster angle of 32 degrees provides an extended wheel base of 1525mm, making its straight running ability superb. The wide, pull back type of handle bars and the forward placed foot rests, allow the rider to sit up as if he was on a horse. A separate looking, loose cushion seat is almost like sitting on a sofa, and it is positioned at a height of only 715mm. The 70hp 981cc twin cylinder is in the ""V"" format and transmits its power via an enclosed drive shaft for quiet, maintenance free operation. The bike comes with much chrome and lots of gold plating, but it is done in such a manner that the bike does not look gaudy. It is a luxurious and comfortable riding motorcycle, designed for the American bike enthusiast, but sure to be well received throughout the globe. The Virago seems to have the custom made finish and individual 60's styling that characterizes the true ""Chopper"" of America.</p>

<p>Honda's release of their limited production, road-going, ""works racer"" VFR750R made headlines in the motorcycle scene in 1987. The VFR750R is a street-legal counterpart of the formidable RVF750 endurance racer which displayed remarkable potential in the world endurance championships. This bike follows the concept seen in the RVF750, including the use of space-age technology and components such as titanium, carbon-fiber, kevlar, and magnesium. It betters the earlier bikes by a wide margin. The VFR750R also uses a twin-spar aluminum box frame, Pro-Arm (rear swing arm), and a center-lock hub rear wheel. These superlative features and the RVF's racing reputation have made it a collector's item even before the first unit was off the production line. The 748cc, liquid cooled, V4 cylinder 16 valve engine has been kept compact to keep the VFR's overall dimensions very close to the current 500cc Grand Prix racers, for a minimum frontal area. Further, this motorcycle departs from the typical Japanese mass-production practice by using a great deal of human labor on each unit, such as the FRP cowling and windscreen being laid up by hand. The Honda VFR750R is one potent package and has been designed to be very competitive on racing tracks in stock form, yet remain street legal. It will remain a desirable and elusive high performance bike for years to come.</p>

<p>This scale model assembly kit recreates the 2018 spec of the highly successful YZF-R1M. 2018 is a landmark year for the long-running YZF-R1, as it celebrates its 20th anniversary. The YZF-R1M is the eighth generation of the bike, released in 2015. It was designed as a circuit motorcycle, and its design and technology were heavily influenced by data harvested from the YZR-M1 MotoGP bike. The YZF-R1M has appeared in races such as the Superbike World Championship and All Japan Road Race Championship, one of its highly notable achievements being an astounding three back-to-back wins of the Suzuka 8 Hours between 2015 and 2017. The Tamiya assembly kit model faithfully captures all the details of the full-size bike in every way.</p>

<p>This Tamiya 1/12 model replica recreates the all-new Honda Monkey 125. The Monkey line was first sold in Japan in 1967, and soon gained long-lasting worldwide acclaim with its rather diminutive yet cheerful design. The Monkey 125 features a bigger 124cc engine, yet is packed with the Monkey’s trademark cheeky charm – chunky tires, rounded design motifs for headlight, speedo and more, plus gleaming chromed fenders and muffler cover.</p>

<p>This model kit recreates a customized version of the Yamaha XV1600 Road Star. The standard kit is available as item 14080. The XV1600 Road Star featured a 1,600cc V-twin that made it one of the most powerful motorcycles of its day, with telescopic front suspension and a rear shock tucked out of sight for a classic hardtail look to accentuate the low-slung lines, and liberal use of chrome. Customized bikes had side bags, a larger windshield, and many more variations.</p>

<p>This model assembly kit recreates the Honda CBR1000RR-R Fireblade SP bike by Honda. Announced in 2019 in Milan, this bike has a decidedly circuit-oriented feel exemplified by a 1,000cc inline-four engine with the same bore-stroke ratio as the RC213V MotoGP machine, finely honed cowl designs (the bike’s drag coefficient of 0.27 is unrivalled by other production motorcycles), a full suite of electronic rider aids and titanium Akrapovič muffler: truly a crystallization of the top notch technique at Honda, and an exciting new chapter for the famed Fireblade name. The bike is planned for entry into the World SBK in 2020.</p>

Additionally, using folding tripod Lafette and the telephoto optical sight helped these machine guns worked at long range. The attachment of loader magazine allowed firing by one soldier. A machine gun team normally had from three to five soldiers: one pair (one gunner and one loader) and other soldiers who carry ammunition, spare gun barrels and tripod. Their mission ranged from defense from enemies to support of troops.</p>
